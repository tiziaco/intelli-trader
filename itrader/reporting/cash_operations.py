"""Cash-ledger snapshot serializer for the E2E cash_operations golden (Phase 8, D-02).

The opt-in sibling of ``itrader.reporting.orders`` — for scenarios whose ASSERTION
is the cash reservation/release lifecycle (CASH-01 no-commit, CASH-02 release on a
terminal state) rather than a closed trade or the order mirror. It joins the same
reporting serializer family: pandas + stdlib only, a DUCK-TYPED ``operations`` input
(``CashOperation``-shaped objects, NO handler import), the same
rows→DataFrame→sort→reset idiom, and ``float(...)`` only at the serialization edge
(Decimal stays internal upstream).

Determinism contract (D-02)
---------------------------
Business columns ONLY: a DERIVED ``correlation`` label, ``operation_type``,
``amount``, ``balance_before``, ``balance_after``. THREE source fields are EXCLUDED
because they are non-deterministic across runs:

* ``operation_id`` — a UUIDv7 minted per record (cash_manager.py:34).
* ``reference_id`` — the raw order id (a UUIDv7) keying the reservation.
* ``timestamp`` — RESERVATION / RELEASE_RESERVATION rows stamp ``datetime.now(UTC)``
  (admission audit wall-clock — cash_manager.py:409,441), NOT an event-derived
  business time, so it is never oracle-safe to freeze.

To keep a RESERVATION matchable to its RELEASE WITHOUT exposing the raw id, the
``correlation`` label is derived the way ``orders.py::_order_role`` derives a stable
label from linkage flags instead of a raw UUID: each distinct ``reference_id`` is
assigned a stable ordinal in first-appearance order and labelled ``ORDER-{n}`` (a
``None`` reference — e.g. a DEPOSIT seed — maps to a single ``ACCOUNT`` label).
``operation_type`` serializes via ``op.operation_type.name`` (mirrors orders.py
``o.status.name``). Rows are sorted by a stable business key (the derived
correlation, then operation_type, then amount as a tiebreak) so order is
reproducible across runs.

Indentation: 4 spaces (reporting package house style).
