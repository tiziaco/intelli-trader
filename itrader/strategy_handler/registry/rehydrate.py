"""The D-01 rehydrate seam: the stored strategy roster becomes live instances at boot.

**D-01 — the load-bearing reframe.** Strategy *types* are CODE: the application hands them
to the engine through the injected catalog (the owner's proprietary strategies live in a
private submodule repo), so ``itrader`` never imports a concrete strategy class. Strategy
*instances* are DATA: the store is their source of truth. Rehydrate therefore INSTANTIATES
from ``store x catalog x codec`` — ``for rec in store.list_active(): cls =
catalog[rec["strategy_type"]]; add_strategy(cls(**params))``. It does NOT re-apply stored
state onto a roster hardcoded in composition code, because that would make code, not the
store, the source of truth for WHAT TRADES.

**D-19 — two arms, and they pull in opposite directions.**

* PER-INSTANCE failure (``strategy_type`` retired from the catalog, ``config_json`` that
  will not deserialize after param drift) -> SKIP that instance, fire ONE CRITICAL alert,
  and CONTINUE. The owner's strategy submodule evolves independently of rows already on
  disk, so drift is a certainty rather than a risk; letting one stale row block every
  healthy strategy would turn a data problem into a self-inflicted outage.
* INFRASTRUCTURE failure (rows exist but no catalog was injected; the store is unreadable)
  -> FAIL LOUD. That is a wiring bug, and a live engine that appears healthy while trading
  nothing is worse than one that refuses to boot.

Consequently this module is **NOT** blanket-wrapped in a degrade-clean ``except``: that
pattern is right for the config-layering path next door, but here it would invert the second
arm into exactly the silent boot-with-zero-strategies the first paragraph calls worse.

**"Skip" and "loud" are orthogonal.** Loudness comes from the ``alert_sink`` CRITICAL
channel — the same egress a halt uses — not from halting. A quarantined instance is
reported, not fatal.

**D-19 — the row is NEVER mutated.** Quarantine never flips the row's ``enabled`` flag off,
and writes nothing back at all. The DB holds the operator's declared INTENT; the runtime's
job is to report that it could not load the row, not to rewrite what the operator asked
for. Turning that flag off would silently
convert a transient code-drift problem into a permanent one that SURVIVES THE FIX: repairing
the class and restarting would leave the strategy dark until someone remembered to
re-enable it by hand. This is the decision in this module most likely to be "helpfully"
undone by a later reader — it is deliberate.

**D-02** — ``strategy_name`` is the only restart-stable identity. ``add_strategy``
loud-rejects a duplicate name (a collision would silently overwrite another instance's
persisted state), and each rebuilt instance mints a FRESH ephemeral ``strategy_id`` UUIDv7
per construction; no second durable id exists.

**D-16** — a ``PairStrategy`` row takes the identical path. This module holds no
type-sniffing branch and no pair special case: excluding pairs would mean pairs do not
survive restart. (A pair is ``LONG_SHORT``, so the handler's SHORT-01/D-07 registration
gate still applies to a rebuilt instance exactly as it does to a hand-added one — that
rejection is a system-level misconfiguration, not a bad row, so it is not quarantined.)

**D-21** — an EMPTY registry is a VALID first-start state. A fresh DB means zero strategies:
boot completes, the engine trades nothing and waits. There is no seed-from-config path.

**D-05/GATE-01** — this module is reached only from inside ``build_live_system``'s
``system_store is not None`` gate and is never barrel-exported from ``strategy_handler``, so
the backtest import path stays SQL-free. It imports no store class: the store arrives
injected, as a duck-typed handle.
