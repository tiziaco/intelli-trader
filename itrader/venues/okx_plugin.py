"""Concrete OKX venue / data / connector plugins (05-05, VENUE-02, D-03/D-04/D-07).

Formalizes the ``if self.exchange == 'okx'`` composition-root block
(``live_trading_system.py`` ~470-552) into three registrable plugins so a venue
registers WITHOUT editing ``LiveTradingSystem``:

  - ``OkxConnectorPlugin`` — the per-venue connector build recipe
    (``ConnectorProvider`` calls ``build(spec)`` once per ``(venue, account_id)``).
  - ``OkxVenuePlugin`` — builds the execution ``VenueBundle`` (an ``OkxExchange``
    over the shared connector + a ``VenueAccount`` factory).
  - ``OkxDataPlugin`` — builds the ``OkxDataProvider`` over the SAME shared
    connector (both arms call ``connectors.get("okx", account_id, spec)`` so one
    ``ccxt.pro`` client serves the exec + data arms for a key, D-03).

CRITICAL — D-04 triple-deferral laziness (the P5 inertness gate, cred-less
machines): EVERY ``build*`` keeps the OKX concretion ``import`` AND the
``OkxSettings()`` credential construction INSIDE the method body. This module
imports NOTHING heavy at module scope — ``from __future__ import annotations`` +
``TYPE_CHECKING``-only annotations keep it ccxt/async/SQL-free, so importing (and
registering) an OKX plugin pulls no ``ccxt.pro`` / ``OkxConnector`` / ``OkxSettings``
(register ≠ build). Hoisting any of these imports to module top silently reddens
``tests/integration/test_okx_inertness.py`` — DO NOT hoist them.

Stream target: the OKX stream symbol/timeframe are read from the injected
``ctx.config.stream`` INSIDE ``build*`` (IN-01 — ``EngineContext.config`` is the
process-wide ``SystemConfig`` singleton wired at the composition root; one wiring
source, no inline default-construction). The account is a single default
``VenueAccount`` (D-07 — the per-portfolio ``account_id`` fan-out is P11).

Indentation: 4-SPACE (``venues/`` package convention). ``mypy --strict`` applies.
