"""VenueCorrelationIndex — the OKX arm's venue-correlation state, encapsulated (WR-05).

WR-05 flagged the four insert-only correlation structures on ``OkxExchange`` — the three
venue-id / order-id / clOrdId maps plus the ``_seen_trade_ids`` dedup set — as *insert-only*:
nothing is ever removed, so over a long live session every order and trade id is retained
(unbounded memory). This class lifts that state (plus the ``_pending_fills_by_venue_id``
late-fill buffer and the ``_correlation_lock``) out of the exchange into ONE cohesive,
socket-free, unit-testable unit so the growth can be bounded and exercised without a socket:

- **R1 — encapsulation.** All correlation state + its lock live here; ``OkxExchange``
  delegates. ``register`` / ``register_pending`` / ``adopt`` write; ``resolve`` reads (the
  fill-correlation path, atomic under the lock — dedup + venue-id/clOrdId resolve + buffer +
  mark-seen in one hold, preserving the WR-03 cross-thread guarantee); ``mark_seen`` dedups.
- **R2 — release-on-terminal (fill-driven).** A per-``venue_id`` cumulative-filled ``Decimal``
  counter (``record_fill``) reports terminal when cumulative reaches ``order.quantity``
  (WR05-D1 — the index self-releases entirely inside the execution domain, NOT coupled to
  ``ReconcileManager``); ``release`` then drains any buffered late fills and drops the order's
  entries (drain-then-evict, WR05-D3), idempotent on an unknown / already-released venue_id.
- **R3 — bounded dedup ring.** ``_seen_trade_ids`` is a ``deque(maxlen=capacity)`` FIFO ring
  (mirroring the ``live_bar_feed.py`` ``deque(maxlen=cache_capacity())`` precedent) + a
  companion ``set`` for O(1) membership (WR05-D2); the oldest id is evicted past capacity. The
  durable ``venue_trade_id`` DB layer (CR-01) is the evicted-then-resent backstop.

Import discipline (backtest-inertness gate): stdlib + ``itrader.core.ids`` +
``itrader.events_handler.events`` + ``itrader.core.exceptions`` (typed guard) +
``itrader.logger`` (buffer-overflow alarm) ONLY — NO ccxt, NO connector concretion — so this
module is structurally inert on the backtest hot path.

Indentation: this tree is TAB-indented (a mixed-indent diff breaks the file).
