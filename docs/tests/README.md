## Key Testing Patterns and Best Practices

### 1. **State-Based Testing**
- Tests verify proper state transitions and state consistency
- Comprehensive validation of order lifecycle states
- Audit trail verification for all state changes

### 2. **Edge Case Coverage**
- Invalid input handling (malformed signals, invalid quantities)
- Boundary conditions (overfills, negative quantities)
- Error condition testing with proper error messages

### 3. **Integration Testing**
- End-to-end signal processing through the full pipeline
- Mock-based testing to isolate components
- Real workflow simulation with proper dependencies

### 4. **Data Consistency Testing**
- Storage consistency across operations
- Query result accuracy
- State synchronization between components

### 5. **Backward Compatibility**
- Legacy method compatibility maintained
- Gradual migration path for existing code
- No breaking changes to existing APIs

## Test Execution

## Test Dependencies and Setup

### Required Mock Objects
- **Portfolio Handler:** Mocked for portfolio constraints and cash validation
- **Compliance Manager:** Mocked to control signal verification flow  
- **Position Sizer:** Mocked to avoid interfering with order sizing
- **Risk Manager:** Mocked to control order refinement process

### Test Data Patterns
- **Signals:** Use realistic market data (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL at ~$150, crypto BTCUSDT at ~$40,000)
- **Orders:** Test both LIMIT (remain active) and MARKET (immediate execution) types
- **Portfolios:** Mock portfolios with sufficient cash ($1,000-$100,000) for testing
- **Time:** Use timezone-aware datetime objects for proper time handling
