## Financial Logic Improvements

### Correct Short Position Handling

**Traditional Approach (Incorrect)**:
- Short position market value: +$10,000 (wrong)
- Total equity: Cash + All positive market values

**New Approach (Correct)**:
- Short position market value: -$10,000 (liability)
- Total equity: Cash + Market values (shorts are negative)

### Enhanced Cash Flow Management

**Short Sale Example**:
1. **Open Short**: Sell 1 BTC at $40,000
   - Cash increases by $40,000 (receive proceeds)
   - Position value: -$40,000 (liability)
   - Net equity: No change (correct)

2. **Price Movement**: BTC rises to $45,000
   - Position value: -$45,000 (increased liability)
   - Unrealized loss: $5,000

3. **Close Short**: Buy 1 BTC at $45,000
   - Cash decreases by $45,000 (pay to close)
   - Position closed
   - Realized loss: $5,000
