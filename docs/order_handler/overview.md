# Order Handler Overview & Features

## Introduction

The iTrader Order Handler has been completely refactored to provide professional-grade order management capabilities. The system now features centralized order orchestration, professional order lifecycle management, and true One-Cancels-Other (OCO) functionality.

## Key Features

### üéØ **Centralized Order Management**
- **OrderManager**: Single point of orchestration for all order operations
- **Unified Pipeline**: Streamlined order processing from signal to execution
- **Event-Driven**: Clean separation between order logic and event handling

### üìä **Professional Order Lifecycle**
- **SQL-Mimicking Storage**: Orders behave like database records
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All orders preserved for regulatory compliance
- **Status Tracking**: Comprehensive order state management
- **Historical Records**: Filled orders maintained for analysis

### ‚ö° **Configurable Execution Modes**
- **Immediate Execution**: Market orders execute instantly (live trading)
- **Next-Bar Execution**: Market orders execute on next bar (realistic backtesting)
- **Flexible Configuration**: Easy switching between modes

### üîÑ **True OCO (One-Cancels-Other)**
- **Professional Behavior**: When SL triggers, TP is cancelled (and vice versa)
- **Audit Trail Preservation**: Cancelled orders remain in storage
- **Position Management**: Proper position closure handling
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Complete order history maintained

### üõ°Ô∏è **Enhanced Validation & Risk Management**
- **Multi-Level Validation**: Signal validation at multiple stages
- **Business Rule Compliance**: Comprehensive compliance checking
