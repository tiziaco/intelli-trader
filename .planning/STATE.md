# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-04)

**Core value:** A single backtest run of `SMA_MACD` on the golden BTCUSD CSV produces correct, deterministic, cross-validated numbers — the backtest path must import, run, and yield trustworthy results.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — M1: Ignition + Lock the Oracle

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (M1 — Ignition + Lock the Oracle)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-04 -- Phase 01 planning complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Money = Decimal end-to-end (float money is a correctness defect)
- IDs = single UUIDv7 scheme via `uuid-utils`
- Golden-master two-layer oracle: behavioral oracle (trade timing) is law M2→M4; numerical oracle re-baselines only after M2 (Phase 3) and after M5 (Phase 8)
- Position sizing: strategy declares policy + SL/TP, order/risk layer resolves per-portfolio quantity; M1 implements the minimal seam (Phase 1) so M5 extends rather than replaces it (Phase 7)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 first work is Critical #34: the run path does not import today (the only Critical that blocks execution). Everything downstream depends on resolving it, then capturing + committing the reference output.
- Golden-master gates are hard phase-boundary criteria: end of Phase 3 (re-freeze numerical oracle), Phases 4–5 behavior/value-preserving, end of Phase 8 (cross-validate + freeze final oracle).
- New issues found during execution go to COVERAGE-INDEX §E (delta log) with owner approval — never silently folded into the running phase.

## Deferred Items

| D-screener | Screener / rebalance loop wiring | Deferred | Program start |
| D-compliance | Compliance layer (long_only/short_only) | Deferred | Program start |
| D-oanda | OANDA + Binance adapters | Deferred | Program start |
| OUT | `my_strategies/*` (relocated to separate repo by user) | Out-of-band | Program start |
