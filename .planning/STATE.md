# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (Current Milestone: v1.8 — Live System Refactor & Live-Readiness Hardening)

**Core value:** A single backtest run of `SMA_MACD` on the golden BTCUSD CSV produces correct,
deterministic, cross-validated numbers (oracle **134 / `46189.87730727451`**; v1.5 W1 baseline 15.7 s /
152.8 MB). v1.7 shipped a live operating mode (paper-first on OKX) without disturbing that oracle.
**Current focus:** Phase 11 — multi-portfolio-live
thin ~200-line facade over focused, venue-parametrized, FastAPI-ready collaborators — **without
disturbing the byte-exact oracle or the OKX import-inertness gate**. FastAPI itself is out of scope
(LR-01). Full scope: core refactor (P1–P8 + P12 + P13) + the three ★ feature-adds (P9–P11).

## Current Position

Phase: 11.1 — Account Provisioning + Mandatory Account Identity (INSERTED; structural half only, per D-16)
Plan: 10 plans in 7 waves — **Ready to execute**
Status: **PLANNED.** The "discussion PARTIAL" blocker below is RESOLVED — the D-16 split moved ACCT-02
provisioning to Phase 11.2, and WR-06 / WR-07 were settled in-file as D-15 (11.2) / D-14 (here).
Sizing and wave split are locked by the plans. Resume: `/gsd:execute-phase 11.1`.
Last activity: 2026-07-22 — Planned Phase 11.1: 10 plans / 7 waves.

**Planning session (2026-07-22).** Research → pattern-map → plan → check, all gates green:
8/8 VENUE requirements covered, **12/12** CONTEXT decisions (D-01..D-08, D-14, D-17..D-19) cited by
`D-NN` token in `must_haves`/`objective`, 17/17 spec-less probe edges authored (10 plain truths +
3 flat-scalar `verification: backstop` markers + 4 flagged `unclassified` assumptions, never
auto-backstopped), 4 descriptor-less prohibitions. Plan-checker: **VERIFICATION PASSED**, zero
blockers, one warning (see below). Artifacts: `11.1-RESEARCH.md` (73d97b1e), `11.1-VALIDATION.md`
(74292922), `11.1-PATTERNS.md` (7e6c063a), plans (c80899fd, 4c67e8ac).

**Research corrected 11 factual claims in CONTEXT.md.** The five that reshaped the plan:

- **F-2 (CRITICAL, now Wave 1 / plan 01):** `ConnectorProvider` is NOT import-inert —
  `itrader/connectors/__init__.py:11-12` eagerly re-exports `OkxConnector`, pulling `ccxt` **and**
  `itrader.connectors.okx`, both in `test_okx_inertness.py`'s `_FORBIDDEN`. D-04 puts
  `ConnectorProvider` on the backtest import path, so GATE-01 reddens unless the barrel is fixed
  FIRST. Zero consumers tree-wide; two-line deletion. CONTEXT's D-04 GATE-01 evidence was correct
  but about a different package (`itrader.venues`).
- **F-5 (CRITICAL):** the byte-exact oracle runs the **legacy** construction arm
  (`scripts/run_backtest.py:68` → `BacktestTradingSystem(exchange="csv", …)`), NOT
  `build_backtest_system`. Editing only the factory arm would leave the oracle green while proving
  nothing. Plans 04/06/07 name both arms.
- **F-1 (CRITICAL):** D-03's "`new_account` loses its `portfolio_ref` parameter" is false for
  `OkxVenuePlugin` — it uses `portfolio_ref` for D-11 account-identity resolution via
  `_account_id_for`, which D-01 does not touch. Decision stands; plan 09 passes `account_id` on the
  config from `add_portfolio` and preserves the raise-on-absent-id guard verbatim.
- **F-3 / F-4 (CRITICAL):** the `'csv'`→`'paper'` blast radius is **27 files**, not "roughly six test
  sites". Two production sites CONTEXT never named: `order_validator.py:117`'s allowlist (would
  reject **every** order → 0 trades) and `universe_wiring.py:98`'s silent `.get` + `isinstance`
  guard (Universe never injected, money arithmetic moves under a green suite — the phase's top
  silent-corruption risk). Plan 06 asserts the lookup is non-None rather than trusting the oracle diff.
- **F-10:** CONTEXT's "~360 lines deleted" spans 11.1 **and** 11.2; 11.1's real budget is **≈186**.
  It is nowhere a plan gate, and a ROADMAP correction note was added.

**Two owner decisions taken this session (post-research):**

1. The `('simulated', DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID)` registry key is **retired in full**, not kept as a
   transitional alias — so F-4 and F-11 land in the same commit as the re-key (plan 06).
2. **D-06 and D-08 land in ONE wave** (plan 07). Landing D-06 alone makes `compose.py:239` return
   `None` and the estimate degrade to `Decimal("0")` — *also* the golden value, so the oracle would
   stay green while the reservation path is structurally broken.

**Planner inverted RESEARCH's wave order:** D-05/D-19 (plan 06, wave 3) now lands *before* D-06/D-08
(plan 07, wave 4). Renaming first means `('paper', default)` already exists and resolves when plan 07
changes *who builds* the object behind it, so the green-and-wrong state never exists. Plan-checker
scrutinised and confirmed this.

**⚠ OPEN — owner sign-off needed before execution.** Plan 09 retains `_attach_venue_accounts` (116
lines) rather than deleting it, for a boot-order fact neither CONTEXT nor RESEARCH states: live
portfolios are rehydrated (`portfolio_rehydrate.py:130`) **before** `_build_account_specs` builds
their `VenueSpec`, so a `VenueAccount` cannot be minted at portfolio-creation time. The
construction-time account is therefore always the compute leaf. Consequence: the phase's headline
"composition stops reaching in afterwards" holds for the **compute-account path** (backtest + paper,
fully fixed by D-01/D-02/D-03) but the **live venue-truth swap** remains — reordering that boot is
Phase 12 / COMP-01 territory. Confirm this narrowing is acceptable, or expand scope.

*Historical (Phase 11, superseded — retained for the record):* Phase 11 locked a seven-wave
decomposition; plan-checker VERIFICATION PASSED with zero blockers and zero warnings; gates green —
7/7 MPORT requirements covered, 30/30 CONTEXT decisions cited by ID in must_haves, 14/14 spec-less
probe edges authored (8 covered truths + 3 flat-scalar backstop markers + 3 flagged unclassified
assumptions). Preceded by CONTEXT.md + DISCUSSION-LOG.md (13945336): eleven gray areas discussed,
30 decisions (D-01..D-30) locked, three sub-decisions explicitly superseded and reconciled in-file.

**Carried into planning (found during discussion):**

- **D-27 / MPORT-07 (discovered, now a numbered requirement):** the **exchange** must become per-`(venue, account_id)`.
  `ExecutionHandler.exchanges` is keyed by bare name (`execution_handler.py:66,126`) while `OkxExchange` holds
  exactly one connector (`okx.py:101`) — so two portfolios on `okx` with different accounts both route to the same
  exchange and **account B's orders would submit through account A's connector**, even with per-account credentials
  and accounts all correct. Verified architecturally sound: every mutable field on `OkxExchange` is already
  account-scoped and the markets/precision map lives on the connector (`okx.py:952-955`), so this makes an existing
  dimension explicit rather than adding one. `watch_my_trades` being a private per-account stream makes it mandatory.
  Now a numbered requirement: **MPORT-07** in REQUIREMENTS.md, mapped to P11, ROADMAP success criterion 5. SETTLED.

- **F-1 (HIGH, confirmed):** `portfolio.py:71` mints a fresh UUIDv7 `portfolio_id` on every construction with no way
  to supply one, while `portfolio.py:68` and `live_trading_system.py:1583-1585` both assert restart-stability that
  does not exist. On restart the prior run's `portfolio_account_state` rows orphan and P10's persisted
  `strategy_portfolio_subscriptions` rows dangle. Pre-existing; P11 is where it stops being survivable. Fix + correct
  both comments in the W4 bootstrap plan.

- **F-2 (MEDIUM):** `_run_session_baseline_guard` (`reconciliation_coordinator.py:216`) returns on the first
  portfolio mismatch — benign at N=1, wrong at N>1. Must become evaluate-all.

- **Highest regression risk:** D-09 moves per-portfolio config off `portfolio_account_state.config_json` (P9 D-25)
  onto the new `portfolios` row — that is the tested RTCFG-03 path **P13's TEST-03 gate verifies** (was P12 before the 2026-07-22 renumber). The migration
  must move data, not just repoint reads.

- **Folded todo:** `b2-strategy-subscription-portfolio-id-uuid-column` — String→Uuid **and** the FK to `portfolios`
  (CASCADE). The type change is a prerequisite for the FK, not cosmetic.

- **Decomposition locked (D-28):** seven waves, ONE phase — W1 Schema → W2 Credentials → W3 Accounts →
  W4 Bootstrap → W6 Reconcile, with W5 Attribution parallelizable and W7 Tests last.

Note (P11 planning): as predicted, the starred header `### Phase 11 ★:` broke `roadmap.get-phase` (`found:false`)
and the phase dir had to be created by hand. Expect `init.plan-phase` to return `phase_req_ids: null` — inject
MPORT-01..07 manually into the researcher/planner/checker prompts, and expect `roadmap.annotate-dependencies` to
no-op so the wave list must be written by hand. Also: `state.record-session` does not refresh `last_activity_desc`
(no registered handler for that field) — it was corrected by direct edit.

Note (P11 planning, CONFIRMED + two new failure modes): every prediction above held — `roadmap.get-phase 11`
`found:false`, `phase_req_ids:null` (MPORT-01..07 injected by hand into all three agent prompts),
`roadmap.annotate-dependencies` `updated:false` (wave list written by hand). Two more starred-header casualties
found this session, both silent:

1. **The BLOCKING decision-coverage gate could not parse 7 of the 30 decision bullets** (D-02/04/11/17/18/24/27),
   reporting `could-not-parse, total: 23`. Causes: a line-wrapped `):**` header (D-02/11/17), a second colon in
   the header with no em-dash (D-04/18/27), and a bare `*` inside `` `state.*` `` (D-24). The parser accepts
   `- **D-NN <no colon, no asterisk>:**`, or one colon then `**`, or an em-dash form with the closing `**` on the
   SAME line. Fixed by reformatting headers only (`dc47ff08`); all 30 now parse and the gate passes 30/30.

2. **`state.planned-phase` no-opped (`updated: []`).** It is template-aware by design — it only overwrites
   KNOWN_TEMPLATE_DEFAULTS, so the executor-authored `Status:`/`Last activity:` in `## Current Position` were
   preserved and nothing moved. STATE.md was updated by hand to what the handler would have written.

Note: `phase.complete` again advanced current_phase to 12 (its next-phase dir-scan skips the not-yet-created
P11 ★ dir); corrected to 11 per the roadmap sequence. P12 (core-final) depends on P11.

Note (P10 planning): the starred header `### Phase 10 ★:` again broke `roadmap.get-phase` (`found:false`) and
`init.plan-phase` (`phase_req_ids:null`); REQ IDs STRAT-01..03 were injected manually into the researcher/planner/
checker prompts, and `roadmap.annotate-dependencies` no-opped (`updated:false`) so the ROADMAP wave list was
written by hand. Expect the same on P11 ★.

**Carried into execution (P11 — found during planning, not in CONTEXT):**

- **F-3 (HIGH):** **the D-25 two-paper-account test structurally CANNOT prove MPORT-07.**
  `live_trading_system.py:1473` builds `PaperVenuePlugin(execution_handler.exchanges['simulated'])`, so both paper
  accounts resolve to the *same* exchange object by construction. Paper stays the right venue for the
  lifecycle/restart path, but MPORT-07 got its own gate in **11-06** using a fake multi-account plugin. 11-11's
  docstring must state why it does not gate routing.

- **F-4 (MEDIUM, and larger than research found):** bare-name `exchanges[...]` lookups are **35 sites across 22
  files**, not the single `on_order` site CONTEXT names (`execution_handler.py:126`). Research found 10 source
  sites; the planner grepped `tests/`/`scripts/` too and found 25 more, including **all 10 e2e scenario files**.
  Three of the source sites hardcode `'simulated'` on the **backtest-shared** path — missing those is an oracle
  break, so 11-06 enumerates them and gates on the e2e suite.

- **F-5 (LOW, sequencing):** F-1's pinnable `portfolio_id` and D-06's `account_id` are the **same signature edit**
  on the same lines of `Portfolio.__init__` / `add_portfolio`. Merged into one task (**11-05**) and pulled into
  **wave 1** — D-28 groups it under W4, but `account_for` reads `portfolio.account_id`, making it a hard
  prerequisite of the W3 exchange keying. A sequencing change, not a decomposition change.

- **C-1 (correction to D-16):** `clOrdId` spans **three** files, not the two CONTEXT claims — `okx.py` (23),
  `venue_correlation.py` (22), and one at `reconciliation_coordinator.py:172` inside the `RuntimeError` string
  MPORT-01 deletes. Since W5 is parallelizable, a two-file completion grep false-passes or false-fails depending
  on W3/W5 ordering: 11-02 scopes its check by file allowlist, 11-07 carries the repo-wide assertion.

- **`id()` alias dedup in `on_market_data` is DO-NOT-TOUCH.** It dedups *aliases* (one object under two keys);
  distinct per-account exchanges have distinct `id()` and are correctly driven separately. It is what keeps the
  oracle byte-exact through D-27. Marked explicitly in 11-06 so an executor does not "fix" it.

- **Two open questions assigned, not dropped:** (a) whether two paper portfolios sharing one `MatchingEngine`
  resting book interfere on brackets/OCO — an 11-07 task that **must complete before 11-11 writes the lifecycle
  test**; if interference exists it is a real defect, not a test artifact. (b) the D-15 invariant runs over the
  **union** of persisted and spec portfolios (11-08) — checking one source is a hole.

- **Watch item — D-09 (11-03).** `load_config()` returning `None` degrades clean with no warning
  (`live_trading_system.py:1266,1268`), so a repointed-but-unmoved config yields a **green suite and silently
  default-config portfolios**. The gate asserts the migrated value by **equality**; a non-null assertion is
  written into the prohibitions as insufficient. PATTERNS found **no shipped analog** — all 11 existing Alembic
  revisions are pure DDL, none move data.

**Carried into execution (P10 — found during planning, not in CONTEXT):**

- **F-1 (HIGH, confirmed real):** `cache_registration.py:226::derive_warmup_depth` is a bare `max(s.warmup)` with no
  timeframe scaling, while `warmup` counts strategy-timeframe bars and the ring is sized in base bars → a coarser-
  timeframe strategy silently never warms. Fixed in 10-03 (opt-in `base_timeframe`; omitted → byte-identical, which
  is what protects the oracle) + loud-reject gates in 10-07/10-08. Ring resize deferred to the finer-than-base todo.

- **Three CONTEXT errors corrected in the plans, not inherited:** `universe_handler.py` is **4-SPACE** (measured
  0/559, CONTEXT says tabs — would break the file); migration head is **`system_stats`** (CONTEXT says
  `strategy_registry`); D-03's policy list omits **`PercentFromDecision`** (`core/sizing.py:278`, a live union member).

- **CR-01 pair guard is broader than D-16 permits** — it refuses ALL verbs; 10-06 re-scopes it to
  `{reconfigure, add_ticker, remove_ticker}` so pairs can still add/remove/enable/disable/rehydrate.

- **A1 (unverifiable from source):** the D-06 drop assumes `strategy_subscriptions` is empty in every deployed DB.
  10-02 counts rows first and raises on non-empty. Worth a manual `SELECT count(*)` before running the migration.

Progress: [██████████] 100% (8/9 core phases; the three ★ feature-adds P9–P11 are in scope on top)

## Milestone Gate (v1.8 — applies to EVERY phase)

1. **Oracle byte-exact** — `SMA_MACD` stays **134 / `46189.87730727451`** (`check_exact=True`),
   determinism double-run identical. **Per-PLAN gate** on P1–P4, P5, and **P6's `UniverseWiring`
   extraction** (highest oracle risk). Any re-baseline (LR-02) is explicit + externally cross-validated
   (backtesting.py + backtrader), never silent. Live-only phases (P7–P11) stay byte-exact (backtest-dark).

2. **OKX import-inertness** — `tests/integration/test_okx_inertness.py` stays green, extended to assert
   **register-vs-build** on P1/P2/P4/P5 (registering a venue imports no `ccxt.pro` until built;
   `SystemConfig` never constructs Postgres `SqlSettings` at import). **Zero new dependency / no poetry
   change** anywhere in P1–P13.

3. **Held throughout** — Decimal money end-to-end; single UUIDv7; determinism (business `time`, seeded
   RNG, injected clock); `mypy --strict` clean on new code; `filterwarnings=["error"]` green; tabs/spaces
   indentation matched to the file (never normalized).

## Phase Map (v1.8 — Phases 1-12, numbering reset)

Dependency graph (not strict numeric order): `P1 · P2` (no deps) → `P3{P1,P2}` → `P4{P3}`; `P5{P2,P3}`;
`P6{P4,P5}` → `P7{P6}` · `P8{P6}`; `P9★{P4,P7}`; `P10★{P4,P6}`; `P11★{P5,P7}` → `P11.1{P11}` → `P12{P11.1}`; `P13{P6,P11,P12}`.

## Accumulated Context

### Roadmap Evolution

- v1.8 ROADMAP.md created 2026-07-09 from the LOCKED design spec
  (`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-07-v1.8-live-system-refactor-design.md` §16, LR-00..LR-22, CF-1..CF-10)

  + research SUMMARY's 4 build-order refinements. Phases derived 1:1 from the REQUIREMENTS.md
  category→phase mapping (authoritative); all 64 v1 requirements mapped (0 orphans). Numbering reset to
  Phase 1 (matching v1.1–v1.7). The milestone gate (oracle byte-exact + inertness) is a success criterion
  in every phase; per-PLAN oracle gating on P1–P4/P5/P6-UniverseWiring.

- **2026-07-09 revision (13→12 phases):** old P4 (SqlEngine Migrations Relocation, SQL-01/02) folded into
  old P5 (New Durable Stores, STORE-01..05) → a single merged storage-schema phase P4 ("Storage Schema:
  Migrations Relocation + New Durable Stores"). Both are live-only / off the oracle hot path, and
  "relocate the migrations dir, then extend the Alembic chain with 3 new stores" is one cohesive unit of
  work; the SQL-02 single-head + parity gate now validates the FULL chain incl. the 3 new stores. All
  downstream phases renumbered −1 (old P6→P5 … old P13→P12). Owner-approved.

- 4 research refinements folded into the spec §16 graph: (1) P3 depends on {P1,P2}; (2) minimal
  `EngineContext` skeleton lands in P2; (3) P2 adds the CONTROL EventTypes; (4) `SqlBackend→SqlEngine`
  rename folded into P3 (only migrations *relocation* stays in the merged P4).

- Phase 10.1 inserted after Phase 10: StrategiesHandler Decomposition (URGENT)
- Phase 11.1 inserted after Phase 11: Account Provisioning + Mandatory Account Identity — DB becomes sole source of portfolio+account truth; closes code-review CR-02/CR-03/WR-03/WR-05 (URGENT)
- Phase 11.2 inserted after Phase 11.1: Split out of Phase 11.1 (D-16): ACCT-01..11 plus the locked decisions D-09..D-13/D-15 move here; 11.1 keeps the structural half

### Decisions

Active program constraints live in PROJECT.md. v1.8 locks (design LR-00..LR-22): two-tier priority
`EventBus` CONTROL>BUSINESS (LR-11); single-writer engine-thread contract (LR-12); handler-owns storage
init (LR-13); `EngineContext` infra-only (LR-14); two registries execution-venue + data-provider (LR-17);
connectors memoized `(venue, account_id)` (LR-17/LR-20); `SqlBackend→SqlEngine`, migrations→root (LR-18);
`clOrdId→client_order_id` (LR-19); config at its owner's cardinality (LR-21); one `system_store` KV +
`VenueStore` + `StrategyRegistryStore` (LR-22). Ten backlog TODOs fold in as CF-1..CF-10 across
P1/P5/P6/P7/P8 (all live-only / backtest-dark).

- [Phase ?]: P1-01: SystemConfig.sql is a functools.cached_property (not a pydantic field) — built on first access only, keeping SqlSettings/Postgres off the import graph; extra flipped to forbid (D-05/D-06/D-09)
- [Phase ?]: P1-02: HaltReason(Enum) in core/enums/system.py — 4 minimal members (D-10), .value wire strings preserved for durable-record compat (T-02-01); baseline-residual free string retired at live_trading_system.py:810; halt(reason: str) signature migration deferred to P8 (D-11/CF-8)
- [Phase ?]: P1-03: CF-6 D-03a reconcile — folded §6d nuance (exchange-side layer real only where called = SimulatedExchange) into item 4 without regressing the post-V17-16 D-10 framing; CFG-06 closed (doc-only)
- [Phase ?]: P1-04: live-only supervisor/feed constants folded into pure-pydantic StreamSettings + FeedProviderSettings (config/stream.py); reconnect fields float/int not Decimal; P1 seam = default-constructed instance, shared StreamSupervisor deferred to P5 (CFG-03/D-08)
- [Phase ?]: P1-04: live_trading_system.py is 4-space not tabs (od-verified); _OKX_*/_PAPER_* retired, PAPER_PARITY_* anchor preserved byte-identical (Pitfall 4)
- [Phase 02]: D-09/D-10: event-bus substrate (EventBus Protocol + FifoEventBus + PriorityEventBus) landed in itrader/events_handler/bus.py, import-inert (Event TYPE_CHECKING-only), wired into nothing — Plan 02-01: pure substrate, oracle-dark
- [Phase 02]: Typed bus internal queues concretely (queue.Queue[Event] / PriorityQueue[tuple]) not [Any] to satisfy mypy --strict verification gate (byte-identical at runtime) — Rule 3 blocking fix during 02-01 Task 2
- [Phase 02]: D-02/CTX-02: OrderHandler + StrategiesHandler own storage init from keyword-only (environment=backtest, sql_engine=None), exposing the concrete on .storage/.signal_store for the plan-02-03 compose back-read; purely additive, backtest slice = same in-memory concretes, oracle byte-exact (Plan 02-02)
- [Phase ?]: 02-03: compose_engine folded to two-arg (ctx, spec) end-state; internal queue deleted, ctx.bus owns transport (D-01/CTX-01)
- [Phase 02]: 02-03: EngineContext = 4 loose fields (bus/config/environment/sql_engine); downstream only tightens types, never adds fields (D-05/BUS-04)
- [Phase 02]: 02-03: global_queue retyped to EventBus (name unchanged) across 5 handlers + SimulatedExchange + BacktestBarFeed.bind; no call-site changes (D-07/D-08)
- [Phase ?]: CTX-04: SqlBackend renamed to SqlEngine; module moved to storage/engine.py; no alias (D-02)
- [Phase ?]: D-01: backend/_backend vocabulary unified to sql_engine/_sql_engine across storage factories, PortfolioHandler, and Portfolio
- [Phase 03]: D-03: collapsed redundant signal_store surfaces; accessors read through engine.strategies_handler.signal_store, no @property added
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 04]: 04-01: migrations/ relocated to project root via git mv (D-10, 5 revision IDs preserved unchanged, single head d10_halt_records); alembic.ini script_location=migrations; SQL-01 wheel-exclusion samplable via tomllib assertion; oracle byte-exact + inertness green
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 04]: 04-02: three new live-only durable stores landed (SystemStore KV / VenueStore / StrategyRegistryStore), each a HaltRecordStore-template clone composing SqlEngine; natural NAME PKs (D-06, no idgen/surrogate); VenueStore recursive secret-denylist guard fires before the write (D-05, Pitfall 6); StrategyRegistryStore two-table registry+subscriptions with FK-join rehydrate + file-backed restart survival; oracle byte-exact + inertness green
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 04]: 04-03: 3 hand-authored Alembic revisions off d10_halt_records (system_store → venue_config[builds venue_store table, slug!=name] → strategy_registry[registry+FK'd subscriptions, child-first downgrade]); new single head strategy_registry; env.py target_metadata registers all 4 new tables (D-02, import-inert Table-only); SQL-02 gate = single-head + upgrade-head + create_all/migration parity; inertness _FORBIDDEN + register-vs-build extended; oracle byte-exact
- [Phase ?]: WR-02: SQLite FK enforcement lives on SqlEngine (dialect-guarded PRAGMA connect-hook), not a fixture — engine correctness semantics must be identical on every dialect the engine runs
- [Phase ?]: WR-03/D-14: 7 durable stores schema-pure (no runtime create_all); production Alembic-owned, tests provision via tests.support.schema.provision_schema; ephemeral results store keeps create_all
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 05]: 05-01 (VENUE-07/D-08/CF-4): one parameterized StreamSupervisor (connectors/stream_supervisor.py, 4-space, ccxt-free) owns the reconnect ladder + _reconnect_attempts/_streams_down; the 3 donor arms (okx_provider/venue/okx) HAS-A supervisor and delegate. Parameterized over transient/fatal tuples + reconnect_on_clean_return so each donor's behavior is preserved exactly; venue's reduced surface PRESERVED not normalized. ccxt+supervisor lazy-imported in __init__ so venue stays inert (connectors barrel eagerly pulls ccxt.pro). ~9 coupled test files retargeted to arm._supervisor
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 05]: 05-01 (CF-9/D-11/T-05-04): OkxExchange.validate_symbol fail-CLOSES (False) on a non-dict markets cache; reuses the single validate_symbol->delta.removed removal path. Seeded loaded markets in 4 submit fixtures + added cold-cache unit test. CF-3 additive LiveConnector docstrings (no signature change)
- [Phase ?]: 05-03: set_bar_sink NOT defaulted on BaseLiveDataProvider (fail-loud — a no-op default would silently drop bars); a bare base is intentionally not a conforming LiveDataProvider
- [Phase ?]: 05-03: OkxDataProvider left unedited — conforms to LiveDataProvider structurally; avoids conflict with 05-01 StreamSupervisor delegation
- [Phase 05]: VENUE-04/D-09: precision is an AbstractExchange.resolve_precision capability; precision_to_scale is a shared core/money util; LTS resolvers deleted
- [Phase ?]: 05-04: VenueBundle.lifecycle typed Any until 05-06 VenueLifecycle lands (mypy --strict forward-ref)
- [Phase ?]: 05-05: OKX/paper venue plugins triple-deferral-lazy (D-04); register != build proven by extended inertness gate + module-scope AST scans
- [Phase ?]: 05-05: register-vs-build assertion excludes ConnectorProvider (connectors barrel eagerly re-exports OkxConnector, pre-existing 05-04 decision); proves venue-plugin surface inertness instead
- [Phase ?]: 05-06 (VENUE-06/SC3/D-06): LiveTradingSystem.__init__ delegates venue assembly to assemble_venue; every if exchange==okx/elif==paper branch removed (grep=0); venue-string init/start guards became structural None-guards; start/stop delegate connector connect/disconnect to VenueLifecycle
- [Phase ?]: 05-06 (D-10): VenueLifecycle is a small class encoding the fixed connector start/stop order, None-guarding paper's absent connector (start no-ops when bundle.connector is None; stop prefers ConnectorProvider.close_all, falls back to connector.disconnect)
- [Phase ?]: 05-06: plugin/ConnectorProvider imports stay LAZY inside LTS.__init__ not module top — trading_system/__init__.py imports LiveTradingSystem, so a module-top okx_plugin/paper_plugin/ConnectorProvider import would pull them onto the backtest import graph (inertness _FORBIDDEN) and redden test_okx_inertness
- [Phase ?]: 05-06: VenueBundle.lifecycle retyped Any -> VenueLifecycle | None (05-04 forward-seam closed); TYPE_CHECKING forward-ref keeps the substrate import-inert
- [Phase ?]: [Phase 06]: 06-01 (RUN-04/D-01/D-02): wire_universe(engine)->Universe extracted as ONE intact TABS free function in trading_system/universe_wiring.py; backtest_runner delegates to it, keeps ping-grid+precompute post-step; ADDS strategies_handler.set_universe (inert by construction) PROVEN byte-exact 134/46189.87730727451 on determinism double-run; inertness green
- [Phase ?]: RUN-02: LiveRunner/WorkerSupervisor/ErrorPolicy authored as standalone import-inert 4-space modules; unwired here, build_live_system wires them in 06-05
- [Phase ?]: D-04 held: live_trading_system.py facade byte-untouched this plan; LiveRunner reaches facade side-effects via injected callbacks
- [Phase 06]: 06-03 (RUN-07/D-17): _LiveWarmupConsumer rehomed to price_handler/feed/cache_registration.py as frozen StrategyWarmupConsumer (ONE global ring); derive_warmup_depth(strategies) is the NAMED CF-10 depth boundary (global max(warmup) today, per-concerned-strategy later — body-only change); register_strategy_warmup(feed, strategies) is the reusable entry point for SessionInitializer (06-04). Named distinctly from derive() raw-history ladder (Landmine 4); import-inert, 4-space, mypy clean; old consumer stays in LTS until 06-04; oracle byte-exact 134/46189.87730727451
- [Phase ?]: 06-04/RUN-06: UniverseHandler ctor is (bus, universe, feed, config); timeframe+remove_policy read from a flat UniverseHandlerConfig value object; set_venue_metadata(exchange) collapses the two former OKX-guarded venue setters (zero OKX coupling); 4 read-model setters + set_freeze_gate retained (D-11)
- [Phase 06]: 06-05 (RUN-05/RUN-04-live/D-12): LiveRouteRegistrar (central declarative BUSINESS/live route table, list order = execution order, FILL appended, NO CONTROL route per D-23/LR-16) + SessionInitializer (composes wire_universe + register_strategy_warmup + first-class UniverseHandler + LiveRouteRegistrar); _initialize_live_session is a thin delegator; _LiveWarmupConsumer + inline route mutation removed; live GAINS the WR-03 assert; set_venue_metadata unconditional over resolved venue exchange (zero OKX coupling); interim Engine holder + 2 casts, 06-06 flips to build_live_system/compose_engine; oracle byte-exact 134/46189.87730727451, paper-parity + inertness green, mypy clean, 2125 passed
- [Phase ?]: 06-06: build_live_system(spec) is the live composition root (RUN-01/D-09); facade __init__ is pure injection; live wires PriorityEventBus (D-23); LiveRunner owns the drain loop; D-12 construction-time session-init flip deferred to 06-07 — RUN-03 lands structurally
- [Phase ?]: 06-07/TEST-01/D-18: relocated the whole replay harness to tests/support/replay_harness.py; production is replay-free (paper->OKX feed, D-21); paper EXECUTION venue untouched (D-20)
- [Phase ?]: 06-07/D-16: TestRunner is behavior-preserving (calls _initialize_live_session before its per-bar drive); the D-12 construction-time flip stays DEFERRED per 06-06
- [Phase ?]: 06.1-01 (SEAM-01/D-04): compose_engine spec-free; store/feed on EngineContext (D-01/D-02, LR-14 amended); bind+generate_bar_event lifted to base BarFeed ABC; precompute narrowed at backtest-only runner; oracle byte-exact 134/46189.87730727451 + inertness green
- [Phase ?]: 06.1-02 (SEAM-01/SEAM-02/D-05/D-10): build_live_system consumes compose_engine (hand-rolled 4-handler graph + commission closure deleted, FeeModelCommissionEstimator reused); credential-probe arm selects only environment('live'/'backtest')+shared SqlEngine so compose's handler-owned storage lands the identical durable path on both arms; LiveSystemComponents deleted, facade __init__ = pure injection over Engine+VenueLifecycle+separate SQL/halt handles (D-07/D-09); interim Engine reconstruction removed (reads self._engine); oracle byte-exact + inertness green, mypy clean, bodies untouched (D-08)
- [Phase 06.1]: 06.1-03 (SEAM-03/D-11): typed frozen VenueSpec (execution_venue/data_provider/account_id) + shared build_venue_spec builder replace the twice-written SimpleNamespace fake-spec; build_venue_spec is the SOLE home of the {okx,paper}->okx default-provider map, called by BOTH for_exchange and build_live_system (inline specs+maps at :274-283/:1605-1613 deleted, SimpleNamespace import dropped); feeds assemble_venue only, never compose_engine (spec-free since D-04); spec-equality unit test proves the two entry points cannot drift; oracle byte-exact 134/46189.87730727451 + inertness green, mypy clean
- [Phase ?]: D-12: trading_system barrel drops the live surface entirely (backtest-only); live consumers import from the live submodule directly
- [Phase ?]: D-13: pure imports (SessionInitializer/EngineContext/UniverseHandlerConfig) hoisted to live_trading_system module top; heavy ccxt.pro/SQL/venue imports stay lazy inside build_live_system
- [Phase 07]: OrderRiskRole is enum-only in core/enums/order.py; classify() defers to SafetyController (Plan 03) — D-16 — one-source-of-truth risk vocabulary shared by gate + throttle
- [Phase 07]: ConnectorFatalEvent.reason is a fixed-literal str, never a stringified exception/payload — V7 secret-scrub (T-07-01); enforced by grep-0 in control.py
- [Phase 07]: PreTradeThrottle computes D-10 notional off OrderEvent.price (limit for LIMIT, decision-mark estimate for MARKET/STOP) — no separate feed injection — The order layer already stamps the mark onto OrderEvent.price, so a feed dependency would add untested surface for no correctness gain
- [Phase ?]: P9-01: ITraderConfig frozen root replaces SystemConfig as the process config singleton; rng_seed moved to config.rng_seed (frozen base), oracle byte-exact
- [Phase ?]: P9-01: SystemConfig kept as narrowed legacy aggregator (perf/monitoring+lifecycle stripped) to keep existing config tests green; SystemSettings/UniverseConfig demoted sub-models added
- [Phase 9]: ConfigRouter: the config structure IS the allowlist (D-11/D-12) — routable keys resolved by live model_fields introspection, so the allowlist can never drift from the model
- [Phase 9]: system idle/timeout knobs AND universe poll_cadence/remove_policy both route under the single 'system' scope (scopes locked to 4, D-21); owning sub-model resolved by introspection
- [Phase ?]: P9-03: order-scope config persists to a dedicated order_config table + portfolio-scope config to a nullable config_json column on portfolio_account_state (D-25); each module owns its config, never SystemStore
- [Phase ?]: P9-03: add_event admits CONFIG_UPDATE as the third default-deny external type with synchronous ingress 400-validation; restart-layering reapplies persisted overrides per-scope from each OWN store, degrade-clean when the (Plan-04) config migration is pending
- [Phase ?]: P9-04: system_stats append-only table/store (engine-operational counters only, NO entity duplication D-17) + state.status/halt_reason/last_started_at written at their event sources into SystemStore (D-19); read-model is lock-free domain-store + state.* + system_stats reads (RTCFG-06)
- [Phase ?]: P9-04: migration-owner finalized the phase chain single-head strategy_registry -> module_config (order_config table + portfolio_account_state.config_json column, NO portfolio_config table) -> system_stats; the hardcoded create_all/upgrade-head parity gate extended by hand (A3 dynamic-enumeration assumption was false)

### Pending Todos

Ten v1.7-carryforward TODOs are **folded into v1.8** as CF-1..CF-10 (set `resolves_phase` at milestone
init; migrate to `todos/completed/` when the owning phase verifies): CF-1→P8 (aggregate breaker, HIGH,
the one with teeth), CF-2/7→P7, CF-3/4/9→P5, CF-5→P8, CF-6/8→P1 (CF-8 also P7), CF-10→P6. Deliberately
**not** folded (kept separate): `livebarfeed-depandas-time-model-datetime`, `mutable-instrument-refactor`,
`margin-equity-double-counts-notional-wr01` (owner-gated), `unify-backtest-direct-bar-generation`
(oracle-risky). `pair-strategy-live-reconfiguration` is folded into P10 (STRAT-03).

- **`unify-config-store-save-interface` (deferred, not folded — owner-requested 2026-07-16):** make
  `ConfigRouter` persist through ONE uniform `store.save_config(...)` seam for all four scopes instead of
  today's split (`order`/`portfolio` → `save_config(config, at)`; `system`/`venue` → `upsert(...)`). Finding:
  the four are TWO real shapes, not one — order/portfolio are bound single-record config stores (already
  `save_config(config, at)`+`load_config()`); `system_store` is a GENERIC namespaced KV store used beyond
  config (lifecycle/universe keys) and `venue_store` is multi-key (`venue_name`) + carries a non-config
  `enabled` column. A blanket rename to `save_config` is therefore WRONG (would misrepresent system's KV
  store + drop venue's key/`enabled`). Two viable paths: (A-light) a `ConfigStore` Protocol
  (`save_config`/`load_config`) that order+portfolio already satisfy, system/venue left native; (B-full,
  recommended) a thin per-scope config-adapter so the router always calls `save_config(...)` and delegates
  to the native `upsert` underneath — B also lifts venue's key/`enabled` handling OUT of `ConfigRouter`,
  dissolving the router's cross-store feature-envy smell. Real design work, not a rename.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **P6 `UniverseWiring` = the highest oracle-risk seam** (analogous to v1.2 MOD-01): move as one intact
  unit incl. the WR-03 desync assert; byte-exact oracle + determinism double-run as a per-PLAN gate.

- **Inertness regression** is the recurring failure mode: no eager import via a barrel re-export, no
  non-lazy `SqlSettings`, no registry importing concretions at registration. `test_okx_inertness.py` is
  the P5 acceptance gate (extended register-vs-build for P1/P2/P4/P5).

- **CF-1 must ACTUALLY TRIP** (P8 hard acceptance criterion): a breaker "green with zero settlements" or
  one reintroducing the WR-06 error→error livelock is a false-green failure.

- **CF-2 threading contract** (P7): `backfill_on_resume` must be loop-native (connector loop), never a
  second concurrent engine-thread ring writer — assert no engine-thread path reaches it.

- **Alembic chain divergence** (P4): relocation + 3-store chain must stay single-head with a
  create_all/migration parity test (the merged storage-schema phase owns the full-chain gate).

- **Indentation hazard:** handler modules use tabs; `config/`, `core/`, `price_handler/feed/`,
  `itrader/storage/`, events package use 4 spaces. Match the sibling file — never normalize.

- **Zero new dependency / no poetry change** anywhere in P1–P13 (adding a lib regresses inertness).
- New requirements discovered during execution are added to REQUIREMENTS.md with traceability, not
  silently folded into a running phase.

- ✓ RESOLVED (fix `f86fe5d2`, orchestrator post-merge gate): GATE-01 quarantine regression from 01-01 — `config/system.py` module-level `SqlSettings` import pulled sqlalchemy onto the backtest graph. Fixed by moving the import under `TYPE_CHECKING` + a lazy in-body import; `test_import_quarantine.py` + `test_okx_inertness.py` + byte-exact oracle all green. See phase deferred-items.md.

Tier 1 appends `ValueError` (validate()/_apply_params raise bare) → WARNING; tier 2 `except Exception` → ERROR + `exc_info=True`. Zone 2 (register/persist/emit) left raising — D-19 fail-loud intact.

| 260720-owe | Close Phase 10.1 review WR-04 (last open finding) — Option B1: narrow `Strategy.subscribed_portfolios` from `list[PortfolioId \| int]` to `list[PortfolioId]` and delete the vestigial int arm. Both secondary-parse fallbacks removed outright (`rehydrate._resolve_portfolio_id`, `manager._portfolio_id_from`) — each already owned the correct loud-failure arm (StrategyConfigError raise / None no-op), so a rejecting-parser fallback would be dead code reaching the same outcome one branch later; failure semantics byte-identical, only the accepted-input set narrows. `subscribe/unsubscribe_portfolio` signatures narrowed too (forced, not discretionary — mypy errors otherwise). Restored the real `Optional[PortfolioReadModel]` annotation on manager.py's constructor param + attribute (module-top import per the file's own DECOMP-02 convention; core/ pulls no SQL so GATE-01 inertness is untouched) — that `Optional[Any]` was the sole reason the `get_position(PortfolioId, str)` mismatch stayed invisible. Removed the now-unnecessary `cast(PortfolioId, ...)` + obsolete FL-02 comment in strategies_handler. Migrated 14 bare-int portfolio-id test fixtures across 6 files to real PortfolioId values first (3 were hard round-trip breakages via rehydrate, not cosmetic). Rewrote four dead String-column justifications (store docstring + inline comment, rehydrate docstring, migration comment) onto the surviving serialization rationale — `to_dict` writes `str(pid)`, rehydrate parses it back — NOT the int arm. Narrowing surfaced **zero** mypy errors (the arm was purely vestigial); enforcement falsified by deliberately breaking a `get_position` call and confirming mypy caught it. No type-ignores, no re-widening. B2 (String→Uuid column) deliberately out of scope — todo filed. 2299 unit + 204 integration passed / 2 pre-existing OKX-cred skips, mypy clean (273 files), oracle byte-exact (134 / 46189.87730727451).

| 260720-s6b | Close the D-10 reconfigure escape that 260720-ra5 opened, by applying the ZONE MODEL uniformly. **The architectural point:** `init()` is arbitrary operator-supplied code, so the exception set escaping it is UNBOUNDED — the old `(StrategyAdmissionError, ValueError)` tuple caught exactly ONE arbitrary member of that infinite set while TypeError/KeyError/AttributeError always escaped. That was TYPE-shaped protection against an UNBOUNDED hazard: it looked like coverage and was a coincidence. ra5 did not create the hole, it removed the accident concealing it. The km2/CR-01 principle (arbitrary user code needs a ZONE guard, not a TYPE tuple) is a property of what `init()` IS, hence VERB-INDEPENDENT — applied at the add site only because CR-01 happened to point there. **Fix, shaped by zone — deliberately NOT unified:** TRIAL site (pre-persist, throwaway, zone 1) gets a km2-style tier-2 `except Exception` → loud no-op refusal logging the error KIND not payload values (P8 precedent), live instance AND DB untouched. APPLY site (post-persist, zone 2) routes arbitrary exceptions into the EXISTING `_emit_reconfigure_apply_failure` CRITICAL path with semantics preserved exactly — no rollback, DB holds the NEW config, restart heals. A blanket `except Exception` across both would have been WRONG (would swallow zone-2 faults D-19 wants loud). `registry_store.upsert` verified structurally OUTSIDE the widened APPLY try, pinned by a `_RaisingStore` test so a future edit can't quietly move it in. **Coverage that never existed:** TypeError/KeyError from `init()` now caught at BOTH sites — without these the fix would merely restore the old ValueError-only coincidence. Planner corrected the brief twice: `build_strategy` IS `decode_strategy_config` + `cls(**params)`, so "scope to the construction call only" would have made the reconfigure guard NARROWER than the add guard it mirrors; and the not-a-shadow assertion is vacuous at APPLY (both classes route to one handler) so it bites at TRIAL. RED was real and verified non-fake (worktree mypy 251 files ≠ main's 273, proving PYTHONPATH targeted the executor's own tree): 6 failed with the exception propagating out of `on_strategy_command` through `base.py` `_run_init`. Policy recorded in comments (every D-10 verb invoking `_run_init` on operator input carries a zone guard, shape follows zone), cited by SYMBOL; shared-admission-seam refactor filed as a backlog todo (candidate after Phase 11) — that duplication is the root cause behind ljn, CR-01, WR2-02 AND this. mypy clean (273 files), 2324 unit (2316 + exactly 8 new, zero deletions/skips/xfails), 13 integration, oracle byte-exact. base.py + rehydrate.py ZERO diff. Verifier passed 7/7 via an INDEPENDENT A/B probe driving real `on_strategy_command` and draining the queue to confirm the CRITICAL ErrorEvent — not by re-reading the shipped tests. | 2026-07-20 | 40d9f214 | [260720-s6b-close-the-d-10-reconfigure-escape-from-r](./quick/260720-s6b-close-the-d-10-reconfigure-escape-from-r/) |
| 260720-ra5 | Close 10.1 re-review WR2-02 + IN2-02 by removing their SHARED ROOT CAUSE rather than patching each site. New `StrategyValidationError(StrategyAdmissionError)`; both construction spans in `base.py` (`__init__` :209-211 and `reconfigure` :747-748 — `_apply_params` + `validate()` are adjacent at exactly those two sites, verified) wrapped so a bare `ValueError` from validation surfaces typed. No-double-wrap enforced STRUCTURALLY by clause order (`except StrategyAdmissionError: raise` BEFORE `except ValueError as exc: raise StrategyValidationError(str(exc)) from exc`), so `UnknownParamError`/`MissingParamError` propagate unchanged with their ValidationError structured fields intact. Consequences: the three admission sites (`:472/:885/:942` — the review's `:397/:809/:866` had drifted) drop the subsumed bare `ValueError` (IN2-02), and `_QUARANTINABLE` becomes correct AS WRITTEN with NO widening (WR2-02) — a `validate()` failure on one persisted row now quarantines that row instead of killing the whole engine boot. Causal chain traced end-to-end by both checker and verifier, not assumed. `str(exc)` preserved verbatim so `test_strategy.py`'s `pytest.raises(ValueError, match="short_window must be < long_window")` passes UNMODIFIED (0-line diff — the highest-risk silent break). `_run_init`/`init()` deliberately OUTSIDE both spans. **GAP — NOW CLOSED by 260720-s6b:** dropping the bare `ValueError` at the two RECONFIGURE sites removed the coverage it was incidentally providing for a bare `ValueError` from `init()`, which runs outside the wrap. Verifier proved this by A/B probe against pre-task `0f4a00a8` (caught before, escapes now). NOT merely "pre-existing, slightly widened" — it is a behavioral regression, though the ARCHITECTURAL hole predates it: the old tuple caught 1 arbitrary member of the unbounded set `init()` can raise (TypeError/KeyError always escaped), so it was type-shaped protection against an unbounded hazard. Add is unaffected (retains its km2 tier-2 `except Exception`). mypy clean (273 files), 2316 unit + 13 integration passed, oracle byte-exact (134 / 46189.87730727451).

| 260720-qfs | Close 10.1 re-review WR2-01 — the `add` verb silently discarded a MALFORMED `portfolio_id`, registering AND persisting a strategy with zero subscription rows; `_emit_intent` then iterated an empty `subscribed_portfolios` forever, so no SignalEvent was ever enqueued and no order ever placed (the "healthy-looking engine that trades nothing" D-19 rates as worse than failing loudly). The `owe` int-arm removal widened the blast radius: `{"portfolio_id": "7"}` used to subscribe and now landed in the silent arm. The identical payload sent as `subscribe_portfolio` DID warn, so the diagnosis depended on which verb the operator happened to use. **Fix (owner-decided):** malformed REJECTS the whole add — warn + return, no construct/register/persist — matching `_add_strategy_verb`'s established SHORT-01 rejection idiom rather than inventing a policy. ABSENT stays a legal no-op (D-09). Detection via a new `_portfolio_id_supplied` presence probe beside `_portfolio_id_from` (chosen over a three-state enum: smaller diff, leaves `_portfolio_id_from` and both light verbs byte-unchanged). Gate sited AFTER the D-02 duplicate check and BEFORE blob construction/`build_strategy`, so it precedes `_managed.add_strategy` + `_persist_strategy` and never unwinds a completed registration; it is a pure dict read (cannot raise, D-10 intact) and sits OUTSIDE both tiers of the km2/CR-01 zone guard, which has zero diff hunks. Duplicate parse at the old subscribe site deleted, now reusing the gate's handle. **Judgment call, pinned by test:** explicit `{"portfolio_id": null}` counts as ABSENT not malformed — a Pydantic `portfolio_id: str \| None = None` model serializes the unsubscribed case as null on every add, so a bare key-presence probe would reject the most likely legal payload. TDD: malformed-reject test written FAILING FIRST, confirmed failing for the right reason (`assert ['malformed_pid'] == []`, stderr `New strategy added: malformed_pid`). Warning assertions use the file's existing `_LogSpy` injection — the test module's docstring BANS caplog, which the original brief had wrong. 152 test insertions, ZERO deletions (no assertion weakened). mypy clean (273 files), 367 unit passed, oracle byte-exact (134 / 46189.87730727451).

| 260720-q6r | Clear the 10.1 re-review (`10.1-REVIEW-2.md`) documentation/cleanup tier — zero behavior change, zero test edits. **WR2-03**: `rehydrate.py`'s F-1 warmability-gate citation pointed at `strategies_handler.py:770/:1005`, but Wave 3 moved both gates to `lifecycle/manager.py` and the file is only 800 lines (`:1005` was past EOF) — re-cited BY SYMBOL (`StrategyLifecycleManager._add_strategy_verb` / `._reconfigure_warmability_check`), matching the WR-05 remedy. **IN2-01**: deleted the dead `from itrader.core.ids import PortfolioId` in `strategies_handler.py` (owe removed its only use; mypy doesn't flag unused imports and there's no linter, so nothing else would ever catch it). **IN2-03**: IN-04's read-through `_universe` property had re-created the exact cross-object private reach IN-01 removed — added a public `universe` property on `StrategyLifecycleManager` (mirroring `ManagedStrategies.pending_removals`) and forwarded to it; the handler-side name stays `_universe` because `test_strategies_live_membership.py:170,173` asserts on it (the review's "no test touches either name" claim was wrong — caught at planning). **IN2-04**: three drifted citations corrected (`base.py:192→194` strategy_id, `:193→195` is_active, and `has_pending`'s "get_universe above" → "below"). Executor re-located every line by content rather than trusting the plan — the `is_active` citation drifted DOWN (359→362), opposite the plan's prediction, because Task 2 was net +3 in that file. mypy clean (273 files), 358 unit + 13 integration passed, oracle byte-exact. | 2026-07-20 | 3316a16c | [260720-q6r-clear-the-10-1-re-review-documentation-c](./quick/260720-q6r-clear-the-10-1-re-review-documentation-c/) |

Executor declined to game two bad gates — refused to pad prose to satisfy an unsatisfiable `self.routes >= 3` count (the qualified `EventHandler.routes` form splits it 2+2; the substantive `_routes == 0` requirement holds), and reported the plan's `<!-- GSD:` baseline as wrong (14 at HEAD, not 12; integrity preserved 14→14). Suite deliberately not run — no importable code changed, so oracle/inertness gates are structurally unreachable. **Known exposure:** corrections 4–8 + both planner-added ones sit inside GSD-managed blocks regenerated from `.planning/codebase/{STACK,CONVENTIONS,ARCHITECTURE}.md`, which still carry the same drift — next `/gsd-map-codebase` will overwrite them stale.

| 260722-g6w | Close the two Phase 11 code-review BLOCKERS that need no product decision, as two atomic commits. **CR-01 (cross-venue account conflation)** — the live composition root derived its account set and attached venue accounts by bare `account_id` STRING, discarding the venue half of the `(venue_name, account_id)` pair the rest of the phase pins identity on (the `venue_accounts` composite PK, the `portfolios` FK, `ExecutionHandler.exchanges`, `ConnectorProvider._memo`). A durable portfolio on `binance/main` was handed the **OKX** `VenueAccount` on an okx boot — so `ReconciliationCoordinator` snapshotted one venue's account against another venue's positions and `VenueReconciler` could emit reconciling fills into the wrong portfolio. Fix is the venue FILTER, not a re-key: `_account_ids_for_spec` + `_attach_venue_accounts` take a required keyword-only `venue_name` and skip portfolios whose venue isn't the booted one, venue resolved as `venue_name or exchange` so legacy `add_portfolio(name,'okx',cash)` portfolios (venue_name=None) are NOT stripped. The lifecycle map was deliberately NOT re-keyed to a pair — `assemble_venues` keys by `spec.account_id or 'default'` (`assemble.py:178`) and every spec in one call shares `exchange`, so the map is single-venue BY CONSTRUCTION; re-keying would ripple into 5 call sites for zero behavioural gain. Existing fail-loud `ValidationError` for a same-venue unassembled account preserved (guard ORDER is load-bearing: venue guard precedes the lookup). 8 existing test call sites updated. **CR-05 (per-account credential bleed)** — `OkxSettings(**resolved)` is a `pydantic_settings.BaseSettings`, so every field a partial per-account prefix didn't supply was still env-completed via `validation_alias`: a prefix supplying only `OKX_ACCT_B_API_KEY` authenticated with account B's key + the **ambient global** secret+passphrase, silently, reintroducing at FIELD granularity the fallback T-11-18 forbids at REFERENCE granularity (and D-04's UID guard can't catch it — the ambient secret is a real account whose UID is stable, so trust-on-first-use records the wrong one). Fix gates `OkxSettings`' REQUIRED field set (derived from class-level `model_fields`, = exactly the auth triple; `sandbox`/`region` carry defaults) before construction and raises `CredentialResolutionError` naming missing FIELD NAMES only. Env source deliberately NOT suppressed — init kwargs already outrank it, and suppression would strip `sandbox`/`region` and silently flip a configured EEA account to global+sandbox (OKX 50119). Legacy `secret_ref is None` ambient path byte-identical. **RED proof independently reproduced by the orchestrator**, not taken on the executor's word: pre-fix derivation returned `['main']` for a binance portfolio on an okx boot (post-fix `[None]`, while same-venue AND legacy-venue portfolios stay included), and the CR-05 test failed `DID NOT RAISE CredentialResolutionError` with a probe showing the built connector carrying the ambient secret. Gates: 2819 passed / 6 skipped (pre-existing OKX-credential-gated live suites), oracle byte-exact (134 / 46189.87730727451), inertness green, mypy clean (281 files), exactly 5 files touched. **Deliberately left open** (need product decisions): CR-02 (is account_id mandatory in live), CR-03 (post-boot attach), CR-04 (D-09 config migration no-op), and every WR-* — notably WR-03, whose `or DEFAULT_ACCOUNT_ID` registration/raw-read asymmetry touches the same code and is byte-identical to before. | 2026-07-22 | 47a0e185 | [260722-g6w-fix-code-review-blockers-cr-01-cross-ven](./quick/260722-g6w-fix-code-review-blockers-cr-01-cross-ven/) |

| 260722-hpz | Close Phase 11 code-review **WR-08** — the last review finding not folded into Phase 11.1. `LiveTradingSystem.start()` starts EVERY venue lifecycle but `stop()` read `next(iter(lifecycles.values()), None)` and stopped only the primary, justified by "close_all() … the memo is shared across accounts". That justification covers only ONE of `VenueLifecycle.stop()`'s two branches: the `self._connectors is not None` arm drives `ConnectorProvider.close_all()` (shared memo, every account), but its documented `elif self._bundle.connector is not None: disconnect()` fallback exists precisely for lifecycles built WITHOUT a shared provider and covers only THAT bundle — so in that configuration every non-primary connector leaked a dangling authenticated venue socket, and a `ResourceWarning` is a HARD failure under `filterwarnings=["error"]`. Fix: snapshot `_venue_lifecycles.items()` into a list BEFORE the `try` (keeps the defensive `getattr` for a partially-constructed facade, keeps the map available to `finally` on every return path, and avoids dict-mutation-during-iteration), then loop in the `finally`. Safe because `close_all()` clears its memo inside a `finally` (`connectors/provider.py:82-91`) — **idempotency independently verified by the orchestrator**, since it is the load-bearing premise — so extra calls iterate an empty memo. **Guard placement (decision):** the `try/except` sits at the facade call site, per iteration, NOT inside `VenueLifecycle.stop()` — that method must keep raising for its own single-lifecycle callers and its unit contract; isolation is a property of the fan-out, and only the call site knows there are siblings left to stop and a SQL-spine dispose still to run. Swallowing here also stops a teardown failure from masking an exception already propagating out of the `try` body. The old `if lifecycle is not None` guard is gone because an empty-map loop is self-guarding. Error log now names the failing account. **RED independently reproduced by the orchestrator** at the pre-fix commit: exactly 3 failed / 99 passed, all three showing `assert ['acct-a'] == ['acct-a', 'acct-b', 'acct-c']`. The 4th test (partially-constructed facade) passes both before and after and is labelled a preservation guard so its green is not misread as evidence. Gates: 2823 passed / 6 skipped (pre-existing OKX-credential-gated opt-ins), oracle byte-exact (134 / 46189.87730727451), inertness green, mypy clean (281 files), exactly 2 files touched. Executor noted two out-of-scope observations for Phase 11.1: `_streaming_lifecycles()` has no teardown counterpart in `stop()`, and `VenueLifecycle.stop()`'s shared-provider branch has cross-account side effects (the first `close_all()` disconnects every account), which matters if 11.1 ever needs to stop one account without stopping the run. | 2026-07-22 | 59eb44e3 | [260722-hpz-fix-code-review-wr-08-stop-tears-down-ev](./quick/260722-hpz-fix-code-review-wr-08-stop-tears-down-ev/) |

- Git tag `v1.7` NOT created (owner deferred tagging to a manual step).

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-07-22T16:17:00.397Z
Stopped at: Phase 11.1 context gathered (structural scope; 11.2 split out)
success criteria + dependencies + 64/64 coverage); STATE.md refreshed for 12 phases; REQUIREMENTS.md
traceability + category tags + gates renumbered.
Resume file: .planning/phases/11.1-account-provisioning-mandatory-account-identity/11.1-CONTEXT.md
Carried todo: 14 pending todos in `todos/pending/` (10 fold into v1.8 as CF-1..CF-10; `v17-residual-carryforward.md`
is the index; the substantive open item is `margin-equity-double-counts-notional-wr01`, owner-gated).

## Operator Next Steps

- `/gsd:plan-phase 1` (Config Centralization) — or plan **P1 and P2 in parallel** (both dependency-free).
- At milestone init, set each folded TODO's front-matter `resolves_phase: P#` + `status: scheduled` so it
  is not double-tracked against the live backlog (CF-1..CF-10; see spec §18).

- Before any live margin/leverage consumer: adjudicate `margin-equity-double-counts-notional-wr01`
  (owner-gated, oracle-dark) with external cross-validation.
