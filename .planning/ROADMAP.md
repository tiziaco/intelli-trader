## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.4 — Margin, Leverage, Shorts & Trailing Stops (Phases 1-6 + 5.1) — SHIPPED 2026-06-22</summary>

Phase numbering reset to Phase 1 (matching v1.1/v1.2/v1.3). The crypto-derivatives surface —
per-symbol instruments, reserved-margin leverage, first-class shorts + borrow carry, isolated-margin
liquidation, engine-native trailing stops, short scale-in, and a market-neutral pair flagship. An
**owner-gated, result-changing** milestone: the three result-changing re-baselines (accounting core
P4, trailing P5, scale-in P5.1) were each frozen ONLY under explicit owner sign-off (tiziaco) +
external cross-validation (`backtesting.py` 0.6.5 / `backtrader` 1.9.78.123); the SMA_MACD spot oracle
held byte-exact (134 trades / `final_equity 46189.87730727451`) across all 7 phases; `mypy --strict`
clean, Decimal end-to-end, determinism double-run byte-identical. Full detail in
[`milestones/v1.4-ROADMAP.md`](./milestones/v1.4-ROADMAP.md).

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.3 — Engine Surface Completion (Phases 1-6) — SHIPPED 2026-06-14</summary>

Phase numbering reset to Phase 1 (matching v1.1/v1.2). Completes the signal/order contracts, the
composition/config interface, and the declared-indicator + strategy-authoring surface — the
result-changing / new-framework items deferred out of v1.2 Consolidation (promoted Backlog 999.5).
Two re-baseline disciplines, both honored: byte-exact phases (1-4) held the v1.1 E2E golden suite +
BTCUSD oracle (134 trades / `final_equity 46189.87730727451`) byte-for-byte; owner-gated phases
(5-6) re-baselined only under explicit owner sign-off (tiziaco, 2026-06-13) + external
cross-validation. Full detail in [`milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md`](./milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md).

- [x] Phase 1: Engine Hygiene (1/1 plan) — completed 2026-06-12
- [x] Phase 2: Strategy Authoring Surface (3/3 plans) — completed 2026-06-12

<summary>✅ v1.0 — Backtest-Correctness Refactor (Phases 1-8) — SHIPPED 2026-06-08</summary>

8 phases (M1 → M5c), 62 plans. `SMA_MACD` runs end-to-end producing correct, deterministic,
cross-validated numbers (134 trades / `final_equity 46189.87730727451`). Full detail in
[`milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`](./milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md).

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.1 — Backtest Trustworthiness: Breadth (Phases 1-9) — SHIPPED 2026-06-10</summary>

Phase numbering reset to Phase 1 for v1.1. Spine: codebase map → data → universe → E2E
framework → interface hardening → scenario waves. LONG-ONLY throughout; behavior-preserving
(v1.0 golden numbers NOT re-baselined). Full detail in
[`milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`](./milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md).

<summary>✅ v1.2 — Consolidation (Phases 1-6) — SHIPPED 2026-06-12</summary>

Behavior-preserving cleanup milestone — cleared the v1.1 cleanup-review backlog
(`V1.2-CLEANUP-REVIEW.md`, 46 findings) + the `CONCERNS.md` dead/fragile/tangled debt, byte-exact
against the golden master (134 trades / `final_equity 46189.87730727451`); re-baselined nothing.
Headline: `order_manager.py` decomposed 1279 → 210-line coordinator as pure code-motion. Full detail
in [`milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md`](./milestones/v1.2-ROADMAP.md).

**Next:** v1.4 shipped (tagged `v1.4`). N+3 — Persistence & Performance is next; start it with `/gsd:new-milestone`.

## Backlog

> Future **milestone-level** seeds — intent + rationale only, NOT detailed plans.
> **Logical promotion order: N+3 (next) → N+4**
> (the `N+x` labels carry the dependency order; the `999.x` decimals are just stable IDs
> and need not match the order). Promote one at a time with `/gsd:review-backlog` (or
> start it via `/gsd:new-milestone`); defer detailed planning until promotion so each
> milestone's findings can reshape the next.
>
> **Asset focus: crypto-first** (locked 2026-06-08). Crypto is USD-quoted and 24/7, so
> multi-currency accounting and trading-calendar / corporate-action work are deferred
> indefinitely — see the "Deferred: multi-asset" note at the end.
>
> **N+1 (Backtest Trustworthiness: Breadth) shipped as v1.1 (2026-06-10).** **v1.2 —
> Consolidation** (cleanup, Phases 1-6) shipped 2026-06-12. Engine Surface Completion (former
> Backlog Phase 999.5) shipped as **v1.3** (2026-06-14). **N+2 — Margin, Leverage, Shorts &
> Trailing Stops (former Backlog Phase 999.4) shipped as v1.4 (2026-06-22)** — full detail in
> [`milestones/v1.4-ROADMAP.md`](./milestones/v1.4-ROADMAP.md). The remaining `999.x` entries
> below are future milestones (N+3/N+4); **N+3 is next**.

### Phase 999.2: N+3 — Persistence & Performance (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Durable state + acceptable latency — the infra prerequisites for live trading.
Must come AFTER the correctness work (N+1, N+2) so we are not optimizing/persisting
unvalidated behavior.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Scope (intent only):

- **#4 permanent PostgreSQL storage** (orders, signals, fills, equity).
  `PostgreSQLOrderStorage` is currently a `NotImplementedError` placeholder.

- **#5 profiler-guided performance pass** (profiler already used to spot hotspots).
- **#1 continued** — structural cleanup that the live-mode transition specifically demands.
- **FL-06** — SQL injection + hardcoded creds in `SqlHandler` (deferred out of v1.3; module
  is quarantined, belongs with persistence/SQL work).

Rationale: persistence + performance are cross-cutting infra, cleaner done together than
bolted on during the live push.

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.3: N+4 — Live Trading Readiness (capstone) (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Land the new operating mode as one coherent, testable thing. Do last — depends on
validated multi-scenario behavior (N+1), the margin model (N+2), durable storage + latency
(N+3), and a streaming data engine.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Scope (intent only):

- **#6 real-time data engine** ready for live.
- **#2 live execution engine.**
- **#7 production-ready universe / screener.**
- **Dynamic universe membership** — a lean `UniverseSelectionModel` poll seam for mid-run
  adds/removes (distinct from, and a prerequisite step toward, the full production screener
  above; grows in `universe/membership.py` per its documented D-20 growth target). Engine
  integration edges: warmup-on-add and open-position-handling-on-remove. Orthogonal to N+2
  (its pair-trading validation uses a fixed pair); sequenced here because it pairs with the
  real-time data engine (#6).
- **FL-13** — `LiveTradingSystem`/`TradingInterface` test coverage (deferred out of v1.3; the
  live surface, not the backtest engine surface).
- **Perp realism — "Phase B" (FUND-01..04, deferred out of v1.4)** — funding-rate accrual at
  funding-timestamp boundaries, mark-price liquidation trigger (resolves phantom-wick risk),
  funding-data pipeline (ccxt `fetchFundingRateHistory` → per-symbol CSV; per-symbol interval, no
  hardcoded 8h), and `freqtrade` as a fourth cross-validation oracle. Purely additive on the v1.4
  Phase A core — only the carry model + liquidation trigger-price change. May land as its own
  milestone or fold into N+3/N+4 data work (see `notes/margin-leverage-shorts-999.4.md` §8).
- **Account abstraction (born here, with the connector)** — introduce a first-class `Account`
  domain object as the **reconciled local mirror of the venue's balance/margin state**. The
  **connector is the exchange adapter** (API keys, order I/O, fill/balance/funding streams — the
  `AbstractExchange`/provider boundary); the adapter *writes into* the `Account`, the `Account`
  does NOT talk to the venue. It is born here, not earlier, because in live the **source of truth
  flips**: backtest computes cash/positions locally (Portfolio = account), but live treats the
  **venue as truth**, so the engine needs a mirror to **reconcile** against (detect/repair drift
  from partial fills, fees, funding, liquidations, manual/other-bot trades). Reconciliation has
  no backtest analogue — which is exactly why the Account is a live concern, not an N+2 one.
  - **Shape:** `CashAccount` vs `MarginAccount` typing (nautilus pattern); one `Account` per
    `(venue, login)`; **Binance spot vs futures = two separate accounts** (cash vs margin);
    **IBKR subaccounts = N accounts under one connection**. Leverage/maintenance-margin/liq-price
    are **venue-controlled** live (set on the venue, cached in the `Account`) — distinct from the
    N+2 backtest model that *computes* them.
  - **Distinct driver from cross-margin.** Cross-margin (deferred beyond N+2 Phase B) needs an
    account *collateral pool* for account-wide liquidation math — a **backtest-accounting** driver.
    The live `Account` here is a **reconciliation** driver. Related, separately motivated; do not
    conflate.
  - **`user_id` is app-layer, strip from the engine.** Multi-tenancy ownership does NOT belong in
    the trading-domain `Portfolio` (current smell: `Portfolio.user_id`) and must NOT be relocated
    onto `Account`. The FastAPI-wrap layer owns the `user_id → portfolio_id/account_id` mapping
    externally; the engine stays owner-agnostic, keyed by its own domain IDs. Removing
    `Portfolio.user_id` is an independent cleanup (constructor-signature ripple) — kept OUT of v1.4
    to avoid muddying that milestone's golden-master re-baseline.

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

> **Deferred: multi-asset (forex / equities / ETF).** Crypto-first (locked 2026-06-08)
> removes the near-term need. When revisited, this is itself ≥1 milestone and splits into:
> (a) an instrument/contract-spec abstraction (partly folded into N+1 config typing);
> (b) multi-currency accounting (quote→`base_currency` conversion) — needed for forex;
> (c) trading calendars/sessions + corporate actions (splits/dividends) — needed for
> equities/ETF, and a data-engine concern that pairs with N+4's #6.
>
> **Cross-cutting tooling note:** do NOT add third-party graphify / Understand-Anything
> tools — use the native `gsd-map-codebase` + `gsd-graphify`, which write artifacts into
> `.planning/` that integrate with the workflow and that Claude can read directly.
