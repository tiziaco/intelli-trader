## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.3 — Engine Surface Completion (Phases 1-6) — SHIPPED 2026-06-14</summary>

Phase numbering reset to Phase 1 (matching v1.1/v1.2). Completes the signal/order contracts, the
composition/config interface, and the declared-indicator + strategy-authoring surface — the
result-changing / new-framework items deferred out of v1.2 Consolidation (promoted Backlog 999.5).
Two re-baseline disciplines, both honored: byte-exact phases (1-4) held the v1.1 E2E golden suite +
BTCUSD oracle (134 trades / `final_equity 46189.87730727451`) byte-for-byte; owner-gated phases
(5-6) re-baselined only under explicit owner sign-off (tiziaco, 2026-06-13) + external
cross-validation. Full detail in [`milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md`](./milestones/v1.3-ROADMAP.md).

- [x] Phase 1: Engine Hygiene (1/1 plan) — completed 2026-06-12

Phase numbering reset to Phase 1 for v1.1. Spine: codebase map → data → universe → E2E
framework → interface hardening → scenario waves. LONG-ONLY throughout; behavior-preserving
(v1.0 golden numbers NOT re-baselined). Full detail in

<summary>✅ v1.2 — Consolidation (Phases 1-6) — SHIPPED 2026-06-12</summary>

Behavior-preserving cleanup milestone — cleared the v1.1 cleanup-review backlog
(`V1.2-CLEANUP-REVIEW.md`, 46 findings) + the `CONCERNS.md` dead/fragile/tangled debt, byte-exact
against the golden master (134 trades / `final_equity 46189.87730727451`); re-baselined nothing.
Headline: `order_manager.py` decomposed 1279 → 210-line coordinator as pure code-motion. Full detail

## Backlog

> Future **milestone-level** seeds — intent + rationale only, NOT detailed plans.
> **Logical promotion order: N+2 (next) → N+3 → N+4**
> (the `N+x` labels carry the dependency order; the `999.x` decimals are just stable IDs
> and need not match the order). Promote one at a time with `/gsd:review-backlog` (or
> start it via `/gsd:new-milestone`); defer detailed planning until promotion so each
> milestone's findings can reshape the next.
>
> **Asset focus: crypto-first** (locked 2026-06-08). Crypto is USD-quoted and 24/7, so
> multi-currency accounting and trading-calendar / corporate-action work are deferred
> indefinitely — see the "Deferred: multi-asset" note at the end.
>
> **N+1 (Backtest Trustworthiness: Breadth) shipped as v1.1 (2026-06-10).** **v1.2 —
> Consolidation** (cleanup, Phases 1-6) shipped 2026-06-12. The Engine Surface Completion feature
> work (former Backlog Phase 999.5) shipped as **v1.3** (2026-06-14). The remaining `999.x` entries
> below are future milestones (N+2/N+3/N+4); **N+2 is next**.

### Phase 999.4: N+2 — Margin, Leverage, Shorts & Trailing Stops (crypto) (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** The matching-engine / risk-execution milestone. Build the margin/liquidation
model the engine has deliberately deferred (D-08/D-09, DEF-01-C), unblocking shorts and
leverage, AND add engine-native trailing stops — all are stateful resting-order changes to
the same `MatchingEngine` surface, so they're done in one pass and share one golden master +
cross-validation, like M5. Also lands the minimal per-instrument value object (`Instrument`)
the margin/funding model consumes. **Extends exactly the signal/order/composition surfaces v1.3
completes, which is why v1.3 lands first.**
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Scope (intent only):

- **Margin / liquidation model** in `MatchingEngine` + cash/position accounting — today
  there is NO liquidation model (DEF-01-C): an un-liquidated short can drive equity
  negative. Add maintenance margin + liquidation.

- **Unblock shorts** — remove the `LONG_ONLY`-only guard in `StrategiesHandler.add_strategy`
  AND fix the CR-01 cover-arm hole (`_resolve_signal_quantity` has no BUY-to-cover arm for
  a `SHORT_ONLY` book — a cover would fall through to entry sizing and flip the book long).

- **Leverage** + **levered Kelly** (fraction > 1 becomes expressible once margin exists).
- **Funding/carry** — crypto perp funding-rate accounting (the crypto-first analogue of
  forex swap / equity borrow).

- **Minimal per-instrument value object (crypto-only)** — introduce `Instrument`
  (`core/instrument.py`, a frozen value object mirroring `core/bar.py::Bar`). Lands here because
  margin & funding rates are inherently per-instrument, so N+2 is the spec's first real consumer.
  **Replaces (deletes) the hard-coded `_INSTRUMENT_SCALES` table in `core/money.py`** — `Instrument`
  becomes the per-symbol source that `money.py::quantize` reads precision from, giving
  margin/liquidation + funding/carry a real per-symbol home (instead of new hard-coded tables).
  **Field set (each tied to a named N+2 consumer — YAGNI gate):** `symbol`; `quote_currency`
  (default `"USD"`, the principled source for cash precision); `price_precision`,
  `quantity_precision` (money quantize, doubles as the lot/qty step); `min_order_size`
  (order validation/sizing — per-symbol, see below); `maintenance_margin_rate`, `max_leverage`
  (margin/liquidation + leverage); `settles_funding: bool` (funding/carry).
  - **Precision, NOT trading tick.** Backtest needs rounding precision, not a price grid; `tick`
    is live-only (fetched from the exchange) and only bites N+2 via trailing-stop min-distance —
    deferred from this value object. **Price precision is layered: declared-wins → infer-from-data
    (guarded: read CSV string not float, cap max dp — DOGE-safe, fixes the catastrophic flat-`0.01`
    default) → `_DEFAULT_SCALES`.** Pinned/oracle symbols (e.g. `BTCUSD`, declared 8dp) ALWAYS take
    the declared branch — inference from BTCUSD data would yield ~2–4dp and drift the golden master
    off `46189.87730727451`. `quantity_precision` is declared-or-default (not inferable — no quantity
    column).
  - **Funding is a flag, not a rate.** Perp funding is a time-series (accrues ~8h, changes), so
    `Instrument` carries only `settles_funding`; the rate schedule comes from data/config, like prices.
    Maintenance-margin rate IS a static venue property → fine as a field.
  - **No cash instrument.** Cash has no price/margin/funding/fills — it doesn't fit the Instrument
    shape. Cash precision = the quote currency's precision (USD → 2dp). A first-class `Currency` value
    object (sibling of `Instrument`, not cash-crammed-in) waits for multi-currency accounting (deferred
    indefinitely, crypto-first).
  - **`min_order_size` moves ONTO `Instrument`** (REVISED 2026-06-14, owner directive). Min size,
    lot step, and precision are all per-symbol trading metadata; in reality the venue publishes them
    per market (ccxt `loadMarkets` → `market['precision']`/`['limits']['amount']['min']`; IBKR
    `contractDetails`). So `Instrument` is the per-symbol source of truth; `ExchangeLimits` is
    **demoted to a venue-level fallback** for undeclared symbols, NOT the per-symbol authority (its
    flat per-venue `min/max_order_size` stays only as that fallback). The full **(venue, symbol)**
    matrix — same symbol differing across venues — only bites in multi-venue **live**, so it is an
    **N+4** concern; v1.4's single simulated venue does not need it. **Population by mode:** backtest
    = declared → default (`min_order_size`/`quantity_precision` are NOT inferable from OHLCV — no
    quantity column; only `price_precision` is inferable, guarded); **live (N+4)** = fetched per
    market from the venue. Reconcile the exact `ExchangeLimits` disposition (keep-as-fallback vs
    absorb) during phase discussion.
  - **Crypto-only, NO `asset_class` taxonomy** — crypto/stock/forex tagging stays in the deferred
    multi-asset milestone (dead metadata until non-crypto accounting exists).
  - **Behavioral gate:** whether the backtest *snaps/rounds* via `Instrument` (vs storing metadata
    only) is result-changing → falls under N+2's owner-gated re-baseline.

- **Engine-native trailing stop** — new `TRAILING_STOP` `OrderType` + `MatchingEngine`
  ratchet logic (track running extreme, move the resting stop per bar). For the
  risk-management-heavy strategies. Look-ahead-safe per the `bar_feed.py` contract. Levered
  Kelly (>1) also unlocks here once margin exists.

- Config hooks already exist and are currently off: `allow_short_selling`, `enable_margin`
  (`config/portfolio.py`).

- **Real long/short PAIR TRADING** (flagship validation) — market-neutral cointegration/spread
  strategy: long one leg, short the other. Deferred here from v1.1 because it inherently needs
  shorts; it is the natural first real use of the short side once the guard is removed. (v1.1
  validates only a long-only multi-ticker proxy, if any.)

Rationale: shorts are the "short half" of the breadth N+1 wanted, but they are gated on
this accounting work — so it must come right after the engine-surface completion, before
infra/live. Crypto-first keeps it tractable (no multi-currency, no borrow-locate).

**Design note — trailing stops on venues WITHOUT native support (spans N+2 build → N+4 live):**
Native trailing is NOT universal (Binance spot lacks a clean native trailing; IBKR stocks
DO have `TRAIL`; many smaller venues / DEXs have none; ccxt coverage is spotty and semantics
vary — absolute vs % vs callback-rate, trigger basis last/mark/index). So make trailing a
**declared intent + an exchange capability**, decided in the execution layer (NOT the
strategy):

- Add a capability seam to `AbstractExchange` (e.g. `supports(OrderType.TRAILING_STOP)`).
  **Native-first** (survives client disconnect, lower latency, no rate-limit churn);
  **synthetic-fallback** otherwise.

- **Synthetic = always keep a REAL resting stop server-side; only the *ratchet* is
  client-side.** Place a normal STOP, recompute the trail each bar (ratchet favorable-only),
  and `MODIFY` the resting stop when the move exceeds a step threshold (rides the existing
  `OrderHandler.modify_order` → `OrderEvent(MODIFY)` round-trip). The venue fills the plain
  stop natively — the engine is NOT in the trigger path.

- Safety property: engine downtime ⇒ trail freezes but the last stop still protects. NEVER
  do the naive version (no resting stop; engine watches price and fires a market order on
  trigger) — downtime = zero protection.

- Risks to handle: modify churn vs rate limits (step threshold); cancel-replace gap on
  venues w/o atomic modify (place-new-then-cancel-old); overnight/weekend gaps (stop-limit
  caps fill price but risks no fill); venue min-distance rules.

- Backtest (`MatchingEngine`) models the IDEAL engine-native trail; synthetic-live has
  modify latency / step / gap behavior → backtest is slightly optimistic (a known sim-to-live
  gap to flag at N+4). Backtest and live should SHARE the trail-computation logic; only "how
  the stop rests" differs.

**Scoping decisions locked (2026-06-14, pre-`/gsd:new-milestone`):**

- **Trailing stop — IN v1.4, as its OWN phase.** Small in backtest: the `MatchingEngine` already
  fills resting stops (`_evaluate` STOP branch) and already has `modify()` (`dataclasses.replace`).
  The work is a `TRAILING_STOP` `OrderType` member + map entry, a trail param + running-extreme
  field on `OrderEvent`, and one ratchet step at the top of `on_bar` (recompute stop from the
  running extreme, favorable-only) that hands off to the existing STOP fill path. It is a DIFFERENT
  subsystem from margin/shorts accounting (matching-engine vs portfolio/cash) → kept in a SEPARATE
  phase so each result-change owns its own golden re-baseline (v1.3 "result-changing phases kept
  separate" discipline). **Look-ahead rule:** the trail updates from CLOSED-bar extremes and is
  live for the NEXT bar (the engine's standard one-bar lag) — never trail to this bar's high and
  trigger off this bar's low. The native-vs-synthetic capability seam is **live-only → N+4**.

- **Pair trading — IN v1.4 as the FINAL, slip-able capstone phase; NOT the correctness oracle.**
  A market-neutral two-leg strategy partially cancels its own sign errors (short PnL sign,
  cover-arm, liquidation geometry — exactly the bugs to catch), so it is a weak oracle.
  **Correctness is locked** by crafted, hand-computable, adversarial scenarios (pure short,
  leveraged long, forced liquidation) cross-validated against `backtesting.py`/`backtrader`. Pair
  trading is the headline "shorts work end-to-end" demo, scoped as a distinct phase so it can slip
  to an immediate follow-on without blocking the shippable margin/shorts core.

- **Liquidation — NO new `FillStatus`.** `FillStatus` is outcome (EXECUTED/REFUSED/CANCELLED/
  EXPIRED); "liquidated" is a CAUSE. A liquidation's accounting effect IS an `EXECUTED` fill
  (position closes, cash settles, penalty applied), so it reuses `status=EXECUTED` and flows
  through the existing `on_fill` → position-close → cash-settle path with zero new branches (adding
  `LIQUIDATED` would force a new arm into the load-bearing EXECUTED→FILLED reconcile map for no
  benefit). The real work: the liquidation engine **mints a forced close order** (owned by the
  position's strategy, so the required `strategy_id`/`order_id` on `FillEvent` are real and the
  fill→order→strategy audit chain + order-mirror reconcile stay intact) that **bypasses
  admission/sizing** (a forced deleverage must never be rejected by a margin check); tag the cause
  with a new `OrderTriggerSource.LIQUIDATION` member (fits the existing closed vocab) for trade-log
  / metrics filtering; the configurable liquidation penalty rides the existing `commission`/fee
  field. (Resolves §9 Q2 of `notes/margin-leverage-shorts-999.4.md`.)

- **Instrument metadata ownership** — see the revised `min_order_size` sub-bullet above: `Instrument`
  is the per-symbol source of truth for precision + lot step + min size + margin params (deletes
  `_INSTRUMENT_SCALES`); `ExchangeLimits` demoted to venue-level fallback; per-`(venue,symbol)`
  generality deferred to N+4 live. (Resolves §9 Q1.)

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.2: N+3 — Persistence & Performance (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Durable state + acceptable latency — the infra prerequisites for live trading.
Must come AFTER the correctness work (N+1, N+2) so we are not optimizing/persisting
unvalidated behavior.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Scope (intent only):

- **#4 permanent PostgreSQL storage** (orders, signals, fills, equity).
  `PostgreSQLOrderStorage` is currently a `NotImplementedError` placeholder.

- **#5 profiler-guided performance pass** (profiler already used to spot hotspots).
- **#1 continued** — structural cleanup that the live-mode transition specifically demands.
- **FL-06** — SQL injection + hardcoded creds in `SqlHandler` (deferred out of v1.3; module
  is quarantined, belongs with persistence/SQL work).

Rationale: persistence + performance are cross-cutting infra, cleaner done together than
bolted on during the live push.

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

### Phase 999.3: N+4 — Live Trading Readiness (capstone) (BACKLOG)

**Goal:** Land the new operating mode as one coherent, testable thing. Do last — depends on
validated multi-scenario behavior (N+1), the margin model (N+2), durable storage + latency
(N+3), and a streaming data engine.
**Requirements:** TBD
**Plans:** 0 plans

Scope (intent only):

- **#6 real-time data engine** ready for live.
- **#2 live execution engine.**
- **#7 production-ready universe / screener.**
- **Dynamic universe membership** — a lean `UniverseSelectionModel` poll seam for mid-run
  adds/removes (distinct from, and a prerequisite step toward, the full production screener
  above; grows in `universe/membership.py` per its documented D-20 growth target). Engine
  integration edges: warmup-on-add and open-position-handling-on-remove. Orthogonal to N+2
  (its pair-trading validation uses a fixed pair); sequenced here because it pairs with the
  real-time data engine (#6).
- **FL-13** — `LiveTradingSystem`/`TradingInterface` test coverage (deferred out of v1.3; the
  live surface, not the backtest engine surface).
- **Account abstraction (born here, with the connector)** — introduce a first-class `Account`
  domain object as the **reconciled local mirror of the venue's balance/margin state**. The
  **connector is the exchange adapter** (API keys, order I/O, fill/balance/funding streams — the
  `AbstractExchange`/provider boundary); the adapter *writes into* the `Account`, the `Account`
  does NOT talk to the venue. It is born here, not earlier, because in live the **source of truth
  flips**: backtest computes cash/positions locally (Portfolio = account), but live treats the
  **venue as truth**, so the engine needs a mirror to **reconcile** against (detect/repair drift
  from partial fills, fees, funding, liquidations, manual/other-bot trades). Reconciliation has
  no backtest analogue — which is exactly why the Account is a live concern, not an N+2 one.
  - **Shape:** `CashAccount` vs `MarginAccount` typing (nautilus pattern); one `Account` per
    `(venue, login)`; **Binance spot vs futures = two separate accounts** (cash vs margin);
    **IBKR subaccounts = N accounts under one connection**. Leverage/maintenance-margin/liq-price
    are **venue-controlled** live (set on the venue, cached in the `Account`) — distinct from the
    N+2 backtest model that *computes* them.
  - **Distinct driver from cross-margin.** Cross-margin (deferred beyond N+2 Phase B) needs an
    account *collateral pool* for account-wide liquidation math — a **backtest-accounting** driver.
    The live `Account` here is a **reconciliation** driver. Related, separately motivated; do not
    conflate.
  - **`user_id` is app-layer, strip from the engine.** Multi-tenancy ownership does NOT belong in
    the trading-domain `Portfolio` (current smell: `Portfolio.user_id`) and must NOT be relocated
    onto `Account`. The FastAPI-wrap layer owns the `user_id → portfolio_id/account_id` mapping
    externally; the engine stays owner-agnostic, keyed by its own domain IDs. Removing
    `Portfolio.user_id` is an independent cleanup (constructor-signature ripple) — keep it OUT of
    N+2 to avoid muddying that milestone's golden-master re-baseline.

Plans:

- [ ] TBD (promote with /gsd:review-backlog when ready)

> **Deferred: multi-asset (forex / equities / ETF).** Crypto-first (locked 2026-06-08)
> removes the near-term need. When revisited, this is itself ≥1 milestone and splits into:
> (a) an instrument/contract-spec abstraction (partly folded into N+1 config typing);
> (b) multi-currency accounting (quote→`base_currency` conversion) — needed for forex;
> (c) trading calendars/sessions + corporate actions (splits/dividends) — needed for
> equities/ETF, and a data-engine concern that pairs with N+4's #6.
>
> **Cross-cutting tooling note:** do NOT add third-party graphify / Understand-Anything
> tools — use the native `gsd-map-codebase` + `gsd-graphify`, which write artifacts into
> `.planning/` that integrate with the workflow and that Claude can read directly.
